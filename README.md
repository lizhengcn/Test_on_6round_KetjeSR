Python program
Search and verification of the 33-dimension cube satisfying the rules in first two rounds:
1. searchï¼šKetjeSR6rCubeSearch.py (gurobi)
2. verification: KetjeSR6rCubeVerification2Round.py (sagemath)

C++ program
1. Tests for the key recovery of 6-round: 
(1) key recovery of 6-round Ketje SR v1: ketjesrv1.cpp;
The program is run in Visual Studio 2010 with x64 platform Release;
The time is about 6 hours for one recovery of 1 key bits.
(2) key recovery of 6-round Ketje SR v2: ketjesrv2.cpp;
The program is run in Visual Studio 2010 with x64 platform Release;
The time is about 6 hours for one recovery of 1 key bits.

2. To give evidence for the rationality of 7-round assumption, we do 2 tests for 6-r Ketje SR v2:
(1) For 1000 random 33-dim cubes with random keys, every cube sum over the L-bit output is nonzero;
TestTermsDegree33on6rKetjeSrv2.cpp;
The program is run in Visual Studio 2010 with x64 platform Release;
The time is about 2 hours and 50 minutes for one experiment.
(2) Choose a 33-dim cube randomly, for 1000 random keys, each output bit has a nonzero cube sum with about half the keys. 
TestTermsDegree33DifferentKeyson6rKetjeSrv2.cpp;
The program is run in Visual Studio 2010 with x64 platform Release;
The time is about 2 hours and 50 minutes for one experiment.
